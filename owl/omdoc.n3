The homepage of this project can be found at http://mathweb.org/wiki/OMDoc/document_ontology.
Note: SWOOP and the WonderWeb OWL validator say it's OWL-DL, but Protégé says it's OWL-Full :-( Cf. the following quote from a paper about the Pellet reasoner: “Ensuring that an RDF/XML document meets all the restrictions is a relatively difﬁcult task for authors, and many existing OWL documents are nominally OWL-Full, even though their authors intend for them to be OWL-DL.”""" ;
