== OMDoc document ontology ==

Note: As of 2007/09/17, the *.n3 files (N3) are the autoritative source.  The
*.owl files (RDF/XML) are generated from that.

The ontology is designed in a modular way.  For exchange, it is more convenient
to have it in one file.  This file is available in onefile/omdoc.owl (RDF/XML).
The tool for generating this file will soon be provided here.

Please see http://mathweb.org/wiki/OMDoc/document_ontology for further
documentation.

== OMDoc 1.2 information ==

The tools that currently support the OMDoc ontology use OMDoc-trunk.  The most
recent version of the ontology can thus be found at
https://svn.omdoc.org/repos/omdoc/trunk/owl.  Changes compatible with OMDoc 1.2 will be merged back every once a while.
