(So far for my naïve understanding of dependency; Christoph Lange, 2007/04/03.)  A generic dependency relation is needed for many applications, but it is not defined in the OMDoc specification.

Actually, this should not only be declared transitive, but also inverse functional, but both properties together are not allowed in OWL-DL 1.1""" .
